Full Stack Coding Challenge

The Challenge:
We want to create a small service for product management (frontend and a small supporting backend)
The frontend: can be either a SPA or react native app
For the backend, we should be able to create and update a product via the restAPI.

Lest go through the models:
    ProductType
        id
        Name
        Created_at
        Attributes[]

    Product
        Id
        Name
        Created_at
        productType
        AssignedAttributes[]

    Attribute
        Id
        Name
        Type // can be text boolean date selecte or multiselect
        
    AssignedAttribute
        Id
        Attribute
        AttributeValue

    AttributeValue
        Id
        Name // can be used for text, select and multiselect
        Boolean // used to store value for attributed of type boolean
        Date // usedd to store value for attribute of value date

The test has many parts we want to try your best to finish all the parts but itâ€™s not
required

First part:
Implement the rest API for creating and updating products type and product

Second part:
Build a simple SPA or a react native app that allow us to list create and update the
product and product type

Third part:
Do you think with this modeling we can handle all edge cases, if not please
suggest a better solution

Notes:
As mentioned above, you are not obliged to finish all the parts but you can use
different methods.

You can use libraries and frameworks as you see fit. - You can use a starter
projects such as
-[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). -
-[expo](https://expo.dev). -

Commit all changes to a Git repository and follow
- Visual appearance isn't important but your solution needs to work on small and
large screens.
- Make sure there's a README with instructions on how to build and run the
application.
- When you're done, send us a link to the Git repo. We will then review your
submission
